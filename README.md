# Python Programs:
Coding assignments related to Python and its libraries. Some of these programs are based on introductory class material, some
are content/references I've made to teach others, and some are personal projects.

enter a rank (a number between 0-12) and a suite (c for clubs, d for diamonds ...)

# Ta Material:
